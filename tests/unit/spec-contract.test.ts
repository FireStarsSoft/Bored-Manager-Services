/**
 * The contract between the module's two halves.
 *
 * A module is a manifest, a `main/` that registers methods and emits streams,
 * and JSON specs the renderer draws from - three files that nothing forces to
 * agree. `npm run specs` already checks a spec against the *manifest*; what
 * nothing checked is whether the main half actually did what the manifest
 * said. A button whose method was renamed in `main/` still validates, still
 * renders, and answers `METHOD_NOT_FOUND` the first time somebody presses it.
 * That is the shape of every "the page is there but nothing works" report.
 *
 * So the module is activated here for real - no fixtures needed, since
 * `ctx.handle` runs while the module is being set up - and every method its
 * pages and widgets call is checked against what it registered.
 *
 * This is a one-module copy of the app repository's
 * tests/unit/modules/spec-contract.test.ts, which sweeps everything the app
 * ships. A module released on its own is in nobody else's sweep.
